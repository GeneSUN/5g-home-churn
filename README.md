# 🕒 Time-Series Churn Classification

---

## 📌 Overview
This project explores how **time-series modeling** improves churn prediction by capturing early behavioral signals, avoiding leakage, and separating true causal effects from noise.

## 🚫 1. Avoid Temporal Leakage
- Add a **time gap** between observation and prediction windows.  
  e.g., use months 1–3 data → skip 4 → predict churn in 5–6.  
- Prevents the model from “cheating” on near-churn signals and supports proactive retention.  
- Focus on *actionability* over raw accuracy.

## 🔄 2. Fuse Static & Temporal Features
Two integration approaches:
1. **Static-as-channel** – repeat static features across all timesteps.  
   ✅ works with off-the-shelf classifiers (InceptionTime, ResNet).  
   ❌ redundant representation.  
2. **Dual-input fusion** – LSTM/Conv branch for time-series + MLP for static features.  
   ✅ cleaner architecture, interpretable embeddings.

## ⚖️ 3. Mixed Causality & Dilution

```text
Dilution Effect of Mixed Causality
├── Problem: Multiple churn causes
│   ├── 20% due to network issues
│   ├── 80% due to non-network reasons
│   └── Single model → diluted signal
├── Solution: Two-Stage Pipeline
│   ├── Stage 1: Service-risk detector (CUSUM / LSTM-AE)
│   ├── Stage 2: Churn classifier using Stage-1 signals
│   └── Outcome: interpretable churn alerts (e.g., SNR↓ 25%)
└── Local Signal Principle (Heterogeneity-Aware Modeling)
    ├── Global models blur heterogeneous causes
    ├── Segmentation reveals coherent subpatterns
    └── Broader use: churn, credit, forecasting, medical risk
```

## ⚙️ 4. Practical Notes
- **Actionability vs Accuracy:** early predictions are noisier but more useful — pick a lead time that maximizes business value.
- **Imbalance / Drift:** use weighted loss or threshold tuning.  
- **Label Noise:** define churn clearly (e.g., 60-day inactivity).
